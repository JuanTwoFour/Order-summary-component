## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned that writing code has gotten easier the more I practice (as it should). The main thing I've learned is to take my time analyzing and picturing what needs to be done, one thing I use to do is try and imagine the whole lay out at once, this was a big mistake as it would confuse me at times when building. Now i take the proposed web design step by step cutting it into different sections and building layer by layer, and this has helped me build faster and with more purpose. 

### Useful resources
